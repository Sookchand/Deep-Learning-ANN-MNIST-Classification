# Deep Learning ANN MNIST Classification
This is a solution to the MNIST dataset using a Neural Network. The Neural Network is implemented using Keras and TensorFlow. The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the model and the testing set is used to evaluate the model. The model is then used to predict the labels of the testing set.
## Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the creators of Keras and TensorFlow for providing the tools to create this solution.
